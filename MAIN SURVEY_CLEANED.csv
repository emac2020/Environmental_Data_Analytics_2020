Historically, almond production and the pollination industry have coexisted with a very good understanding of the mutual and symbiotic relationships and it’s benefits. Generally, In the last 10 to 15 years, there just hasn’t been much positive messaging about almond production from the pollination industry. The beekeeper/broker that we use is always positive has a great understanding of the realities of both farming and beekeeping, but unfortunately he seems to be rare, and a lone voice of reason in the pollination world. We have stopped doing recommended fungicide and nutrient sprays during hive presence in our almond orchards for the last 6 years, just to avoid the drama and hysteria from certain beekeepers. I have not heard or read any absolute and or conclusive peer reviewed data or statistics on bee deaths caused by almond production practices. When I have asked beekeepers generally about the subject, they have revealed that most if not all of the bee losses happen prior to the almond pollination season. Most Beekeepers use the almond pollination to expand hives for future husbandry practices during the rest of the year. Almond pollination also provides a revenue source to the beekeeping industry. If an almond grower needs to provide habitat for bee foraging, there needs to be a definitive understanding of terms of all involved, regarding the added costs, efforts and liabilities.",Never,Always,Always,Always,Always,Always,Always,Always,Always,"Labor costs to apply pesticides/fungicides in the afternoon or evening,Limited communication with contracted beekeeper/s during bloom,The amount of ground your operation's applicator can cover in the late afternoon or at night,Safety issues involved in making nighttime applications",Decreased rental fee for managed bee colonies,,Prefer not to answer,"Decreased rental fee for managed bee colonies,Price premium from handler/processor/distributer",,We rented all our bees,Prefer not to answer,"Contracted beekeeper,Bee broker",,205,8,Prefer not to answer,Prefer not to answer,,Strong concern,Strong concern,Strong concern,Strong concern,Moderate concern,,55-64 years old,Male,,NO,,,,,,,,
